# Terraform Operations API Service

Create an API service that facilitates the execution and monitoring of Terraform operations through AWS CodeBuild.

## Requirements

1. Develop an API service that acts as an intermediary between the Django UI and AWS CodeBuild.
2. Implement endpoints for:
   - Initiating Terraform plan operations
   - Approving/rejecting plan results
   - Executing Terraform apply operations
   - Retrieving operation status and logs
   - Managing Terraform state
3. Create an authentication and authorization layer for secure access.
4. Implement real-time status updates for long-running operations.
5. Develop error handling and retry logic for AWS service interactions.

## API Endpoints

1. Create RESTful API endpoints:
   - `/modules` - List available Terraform modules
   - `/operations/plan` - Initiate a plan operation
   - `/operations/apply` - Initiate an apply operation
   - `/operations/{id}` - Get operation status
   - `/operations/{id}/logs` - Stream operation logs
   - `/state` - Retrieve and manage Terraform state
   - `/approvals` - Manage approval workflows
2. Implement proper HTTP methods and status codes.
3. Create comprehensive request/response schemas.
4. Support filtering, pagination, and sorting where appropriate.

## AWS Integration

1. Develop secure interaction with AWS CodeBuild API.
2. Implement polling or event-based mechanisms for status updates.
3. Create log streaming from CloudWatch Logs.
4. Implement S3 integration for artifact storage.
5. Support EventBridge for asynchronous processing.

## Security Considerations

1. Implement authentication using API keys or JWT.
2. Create role-based access control for API endpoints.
3. Secure handling of AWS credentials.
4. Implement input validation for all endpoints.
5. Set up rate limiting and throttling.
6. Configure proper logging for audit purposes.

## Operational Features

1. Support asynchronous operation execution.
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
3. Create robust error handling with meaningful messages.
4. Develop health check and monitoring endpoints.
5. Implement circuit breakers for external service calls.
6. Support graceful degradation when components fail.

## Deployment

1. Package as a containerized service for deployment.
2. Support AWS ECS/Fargate or Lambda deployment options.
3. Include Terraform configuration for deployment.
4. Implement environment-based configuration.
5. Support CI/CD pipeline integration.

## Documentation

1. Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
2. Provide API usage examples.
3. Document error codes and resolution steps.
4. Include deployment instructions.
5. Create monitoring and maintenance guidelines.
